# Less stylesheet testing

In order to test the LESS stylesheets live, you will need to serve the Swipo home directory as a Website, because LESS uses AJAX, which is only allowed on "http(s)://" and not "file://"!

One convenient way to achieve this is to run ```python -m SimpleHTTPServer <port>``` to serve up the files in the current directory to ```http://localhost:<port>```, which should work under Mac OS and most Linux dists.
